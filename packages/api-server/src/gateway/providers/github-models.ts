/**
 * GitHub Models provider.
 *
 * GitHub Models exposes an OpenAI-compatible inference endpoint hosted at
 * https://models.github.ai/inference. The legacy Azure hostname
 * (models.inference.ai.azure.com) is deprecated and is NOT used here.
 *
 * Environment variable: GITHUB_MODELS_API_KEY
 *
 * We deliberately do NOT read GITHUB_TOKEN or GITHUB_API_KEY. Those names
 * collide with standard dotfile and CI environment conventions (gh CLI,
 * Actions, dependabot, etc.), which would cause the gateway to accidentally
 * pick up unrelated tokens and send them upstream. GITHUB_MODELS_API_KEY is
 * a dedicated, scoped variable that only this provider reads.
 *
 * Authentication tokens can be either:
 *   - A classic PAT with either no scopes or the `repo` scope (public models
 *     access works with either).
 *   - A fine-grained PAT with the `Models: read` account permission.
 *
 * Free-tier rate limits (for maintainer reference):
 *   - Low-tier models: 15 requests/minute, 150 requests/day.
 *   - High-tier models: 10 requests/minute, 50 requests/day.
 *
 * The shared rate-limiter tracks only the per-minute cap. Daily quotas are
 * enforced by GitHub returning HTTP 429 with a Retry-After header, which our
 * normal onRateLimit cooldown path in BaseProvider handles transparently.
 *
 * Model id format: `github/<vendor>/<model>` (e.g. `github/openai/gpt-4o-mini`).
 * The base class mapRequest strips only the `github/` provider prefix, leaving
 * `<vendor>/<model>` as the upstream model id, which is exactly what the
 * GitHub Models inference endpoint expects.
