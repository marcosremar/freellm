/**
 * Provider privacy / training-policy catalog.
 *
 * Each entry states whether the provider trains its models on data sent
 * through its free tier, sourced from the provider's public terms of
 * service. The `last_verified` date is when a human last checked the
 * source and confirmed the policy still matched our mark.
 *
 * Clients can require a specific posture per-request via the header
 *
 *     X-FreeLLM-Privacy: no-training
 *
 * which makes the router filter candidate providers to only those marked
 * `no-training` before picking one. If no eligible provider exists for
 * the requested model, the router throws a typed error the caller can
 * surface to the user.
 *
 * This file is the single source of truth. If you update an entry, bump
 * its `last_verified` date and update the matching website page at
 * packages/website/src/content/docs/privacy.mdx.
